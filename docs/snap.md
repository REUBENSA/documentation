A thru hole, also known as a through  hole, is a feature on a blueprint or drawing that identifies a hole to be machined with two open ends. The hole goes all the way through the part. In other words, the hole breaks through at two locations on the part

There are two types of through-hole mounting components: the so-called axial and radial leads components. With the axial lead components, the leads are placed on both end sides of the component. Radial components have the leads on one end side of the component

An electronic component that mounts on the surface of a printed circuit board (as opposed to "through-hole" components which have pins that are inserted into holes)

Small outline integrated circuit (SOIC)
Small outline package (SOP)
Quad flat pack (QFP)
Plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC)
Ball grid array (BGA).

An SMD is an electronic component that can be found on a Printed Circuit Board (PCB). It is designed to be mounted directly on PCB. Through-hole-technology (THT) involves inserting leads of components into drilled holes in the PCB
